## AI Health Guidance Medicine Portal

AI‑powered health guidance and online medicine portal with:

- **Flask + MongoDB backend** (Gemini AI + Twilio SMS support)
- **Next.js frontend** for patients, doctors, and admin
- **Real Indian medicine dataset** for search, orders, and prescriptions

### 2. How the System Works (High Level)

- **MongoDB** stores users, orders, consultations, prescriptions, and notifications.  
- **Backend (`backend/app.py`)**:
  - Connects to MongoDB using `MONGODB_URI` from `.env`
  - Loads the medicine dataset (`medicines.csv`) for search and details
  - Calls **Gemini REST APIs** for:
    - Symptom analysis (`/api/chat/analyze`)
    - Medicine usage explanations
    - OCR‑based medicine / prescription understanding
  - (Optional) uses **Twilio** for sending SMS updates
- **Frontend (`frontend`)**:
  - Next.js app that calls the backend APIs
  - Separate dashboards for patient, doctor, and admin
  - Uses the AI responses + MongoDB data to render UI

---

### 3. Prerequisites (Install These First)

- **MongoDB Community Server**
  - Install from the official site: `https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community`
  - After installing, make sure MongoDB is **running locally**
  - Default URI used by this project:  
    `mongodb://localhost:27017/healthcare_db`
- **Python**: version **3.9+**
- **Node.js**: version **18+** (with `npm`)
- A **Gemini API key** from Google AI Studio
- (Optional) **Twilio account** if you want real SMS

### 4. Step‑by‑Step Execution Guide

#### 4.1. Clone and open in VS Code

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sravaniyammanuru/AI-Health-Guidance-Medicine-Portal.git
   cd AI-Health-Guidance-Medicine-Portal
   ```

2. Open the folder in **VS Code**:
   - `File` → `Open Folder` → select this project folder.

---

#### 4.2. Backend setup (Flask + MongoDB + Gemini)

1. In VS Code, open a **new terminal** and go to the backend folder:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Make sure **MongoDB is running** on your machine.  
   - If you haven’t changed anything, the default URI is  
     `mongodb://localhost:27017/healthcare_db`.

4. Create the backend `.env` file (explained in section **6.1** below) and ensure it has at least:

   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/healthcare_db
   ```

5. Start the Flask backend:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   - The backend will start on: `http://localhost:5000`
   - On first run it will:
     - Connect to MongoDB
     - Initialize demo users
     - Try to load the medicine CSV dataset

Keep this terminal **running** while you work with the frontend.

---

#### 4.3. Frontend setup (Next.js)

1. Open another terminal in VS Code and go to the frontend folder:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install Node dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Next.js development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. The terminal will show a URL like:

   - `http://localhost:3000`

5. Open that URL in your browser.  
   The frontend is configured to call the backend at `http://localhost:5000`, so make sure the backend is still running.

---

### 5. Demo Login Credentials

These demo accounts are initialized automatically in MongoDB:

- **Patient**  
  - Email: `patient@demo.com`  
  - Password: `patient123`

- **Doctor**  
  - Email: `doctor@demo.com`  
  - Password: `doctor123`

You can use these to explore the **patient dashboard**, **doctor dashboard**, and overall flow without creating new users.

---

### 6. Files Not Pushed to GitHub (You Must Create/Download Locally)

Some files are **intentionally ignored** in git for security or size reasons, but they are required to fully run the project.

#### 6.1. `.env` file (backend configuration)

Location: **`backend/.env`**  
Status: **NOT in GitHub** (you must create it yourself).

Create a file named `.env` inside the `backend` folder with content similar to:

```bash
# MongoDB connection
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/healthcare_db

# Gemini AI (required for AI features)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Optional: Twilio SMS configuration
SMS_ENABLED=false                # set to true only if you configure Twilio
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_here
```

- **Do NOT** commit this file to git.  
- Replace the example values with **your own keys and connection string**.

#### 6.2. Medicine datasets (CSV files)

These files are **large** and are **not pushed to GitHub**, but the backend expects them in the `backend` folder:

- `backend/medicines.csv`
- `backend/indian_medicine_data (1).csv`

You can use medicine datasets from sources like **Kaggle**, for example:

- Search for **“A-Z Medicines of India”** or similar public medicine datasets on Kaggle.

Once you download the dataset:

1. Save the main medicines CSV file as **`medicines.csv`** inside the `backend` folder.  
2. If you use an additional dataset, save it as **`indian_medicine_data (1).csv`** inside the same `backend` folder.  
3. Make sure the **file names and locations are exactly the same** so that `backend/app.py` can load them correctly.

If the dataset is not present or the filename is different, the backend will print an error like:

> Error loading medicine dataset

and medicine search features will not work correctly.

### 7. Summary – Quick Start Checklist

1. Install **MongoDB**, **Python 3.9+**, and **Node.js 18+**.  
2. Clone the repo and open it in **VS Code**.  
3. Create `backend/.env` with your **Gemini key** and **MongoDB URI**.  
4. Download medicine datasets (e.g. from Kaggle) and place them as:
   - `backend/medicines.csv`
   - `backend/indian_medicine_data (1).csv`
5. In a terminal:  
   - `cd backend` → `pip install -r requirements.txt` → `python app.py`  
6. In another terminal:  
   - `cd frontend` → `npm install` → `npm run dev`  
7. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and log in using the **demo credentials**.

By following only this README, a user can **clone the project, set up the missing files, and run the complete AI Health Guidance Medicine Portal** without changing any paths or folder names.
